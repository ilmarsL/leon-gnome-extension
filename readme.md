Gnome extension that adds leon button to Gnome top bar.

HTTP api key and Leon URL can be set in extension settings. To do that you need to instal gnome extensions app for that (gnome-shell-extension-prefs package).
If the Leon installation is on a different server it might be a good idea to use reverse proxy or something similar, since Leon currently supports only http.
